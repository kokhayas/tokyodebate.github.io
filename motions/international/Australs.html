<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Sudan in December 2018 and protests are still ongoing. It led to the removal of Omar al-Bashir from power, who had ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 3 decades. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) was set up, which promised elections in around a year. However, most of the protesters are not satisfied, and have continued to protest because they want an immediate transition to civilian rule. The TMC ‘arrested’ Omar al-Bashir, but he has been kept in very comfortable conditions and protesters suspect it is just a ruse.

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘Cash bail’ refers to leaving a sum of money with police departments in order to be released from jail after being charged with a crime but before the verdict; if you do not comply with a set of conditions including returning to face the trial, the money is forfeited. If a suspect cannot pay bail they are not released. ‘Algorithmic risk assessment’ is when a formula calculates the probability of a plaintiff’s return to face trial, and only releases them if that probability is above a certain, defined threshold.

<h4>That we support governments using social impact bonds to address social problems.<a class="headerlink" href="#that-we-support-governments-using-social-impact-bonds-to-address-social-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A Social Impact Bond is a funding model where governments arrange for private investors to fund a service provider to solve a social problem. The government only repays the investors if the project is successful. Metrics for success are set out in the original contract. If successful, the government repays the investors’ upfront investment plus an additional premium. Examples of social impact bonds include: In the US, Goldman Sachs bought a bond to reduce prisoner recidivism in New York, and will only receive a return if teenage recidivism is reduced by more than 10%. In Australia, the NSW Government arranged for investors to invest in a program that seeks to prevent family breakdown by keeping children in their families, rather than out of home care. The higher the rate of children staying in their families, the more the government repays the investors.

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>India’s traditional village councils (panchayats) are local self-governance systems that operate in rural villages or remote small-towns. These Councils are comprised of local elders. They function as de-facto courts that adjudicate all disputes (civil and criminal) that arise within these villages and issue punishments at their own discretion.
