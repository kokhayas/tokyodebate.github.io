<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The Gross National Happiness Index was created by Bhutan. The GNH Index argues that sustainable develpment should take a holistic approach towardds notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of wellbeing. The GNH Index includes both traditional areas of socio-economic concern such as living standards, health and education and less traditional aspects of culture and psychological wellbeing, It is a holistic reflection of the general wellbeing of the Bhutanese population rather than a subjective psychological ranking of “happiness” alone.

Finding someone guilty based on “Balance of probabilities” means that it is merely more likely than not that the person is guilty. It means that it is probable, i.e., the probability that some event happens is more than 50%.

The Saudi crown prince handed Mr Son US$45bn as part of his attempt to diversify the kingdom’s economy. The innitial capital attracted more investors-from Abu Dhabi, Apple and others. Together with Softbank’s own US$ 28bn, the Vision Fund exceeded US$100bn. That amount was four times the size of the biggest private-equity fund ever raised, and exceeded the total amount of all venture capital(VC) funds raised globally in 2016. The Vision Fund was informally called “the most powerful investor in our world”. The investment fund has bought into many of the world’s prominent tech companies. These include, but are not limited to Uber, Grab ,Ola, Flipkart, and Autol.

Ripple is the name for both a digital currency(XRP) and an open payment network within which that currency is transferred. The goal of the Ripple system is to enable people to break free of the “walled gardens” of financial networks, to connect banks and other financial institutions.While Bitcoin is a digital currency intended as a means of payment for goods and services, Ripple is a payment setting, currency exchange and remittance system for direct transfer of assets (e.g. money, gold, etc.) that settles in almost real-time, and is a cheaper, more transparent and secure alternative to transfer system used by banks today, such as the SWIFT payment system.

Locatec in the headwaters of the Blue Nile and expected to produce 6,000 magawatts of electricity, the dam will be Africa’s largest hydroelectric power plant (7th largest in the world) and will boost the economic growth of Ethiopia. As a downstream, desert nation, Egypt says the dam wikk disrupt the flow of the Nile to its almost 100 million people, potentially crippling its agricultural sector and industries. Experts say the Nile’s freshwater flow to Egypt may be cut by 25% upon filling of the reservoir. Egypt has been opposed to the idea of the dam and has threatened to spark a war over water supply. The construction of the dam is nearing completion, with Ethiopia expecting to start filling the dam as early as July 2018.

Currently, more than 100 armed groupes remain active in the Democratic Republic of Congo and many continued to attack civilians, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and allied Nyatura groupes, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), Nduma Defence of Congo-Renove (NDC-R), the Mazembe, Charles, and Yakutumba Mai Mai groupes, and several Burundian armed groupes. Many of their commanders have been implicated in war crimes, including ethnic massacres, rape, forced recruitment of children, and pillage.

British South Africans and Afrikaner colonists came to Zimbabwe until 1980 when universal enfranchisement and sovereignty were established. Under Robbot Mugbe’s authoritarian regime (1980-2017), the state security apparatus dominated the country and was responsibile for widespread human rights violations against the white community. Mugabe’s government-sanctioned purge in the 200s saw violent seizures of land, murders of white Zimbabweans, and refusal to prosecute those who were responsible for the atrocities.

The violence against the dwindling white community, particularly against white farmers, persists up to this day.

Ties between China and the Vatican have long been stained by disputes over who can appoint bishops in the country. China’s 12 million Catholics are aplit bewteen underground communities that often recognize the pope and those registered with the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Assosiacion (CPA) in China. CPA bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities and they refuse to accept the authority of the Pope. Recent negotiations bewteen China and the Vatican would allow Beijing to propose candidates for bishop in China and the Vatican to select candidates from the list presented by the Chinese. This system would be similar to how Hong Kong’s chief executive is elected.
